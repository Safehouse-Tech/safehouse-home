            Keeping you safe in your own home.
        </h5>
        
        <p>
            Loved ones and those who care for you can stay alert and receive notifications of alarms in an emergency.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The Safehouse App in conjuction with physical, monitoring devices and alarm buttons connects via the internet to a 
            central database and enables those responsible for an individualâ€™s care, to receive notifications and alerts instantly 
            on smart phones and tablets via the Safehouse App.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            It can be used by friends and family or professional care workers to add an extra layer of security into the 
            lives of loved ones and those in their care.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The Safehouse App displays data collected from sensors and connected devices, such as the humidity and temperature and 
            location of the service user which can be sent to a care giver via the Google map link.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            With the built in messenger service carers and family members can message and call directly through the Safehouse App.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Scheduled visits can be logged and specific daily instructions for an individuals care can also be clearly viewed through the Care Plan.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The App can be used in conjunction with the installed Safehouse devices or along side it without them as a means of contacting 
            individuals during self isolation.
